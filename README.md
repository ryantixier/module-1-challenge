# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The aim of the project was to refactor the front-end of a webpage for a major marketing agency; the goal was to streamline the code files (HTML and CSS) and make them cohere to accessibility standards, so that the site could be optimized for search engines. The process has been a good learning experience in terms of manipulating code while visualizing how changes translate from the code to a browswer.
